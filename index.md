**Return to chaos!**
This documentation does not and will not contain any assets that are directly from the game. The guides assume you have legally obtained your own dump of the game via your Sony PlayStation series consoles and/or Nintendo Switch consoles. To dump the game for your specific console, please refer to [redump.org](http://wiki.redump.org/index.php?title=Dumping_Guides) for disc-based systems or [no-intro.org](https://wiki.no-intro.org/index.php?title=Dumping_Guides) for cartridge-based systems.
