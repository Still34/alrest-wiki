Importing Xenoblade X models
You need 3ds Max to extract X models.
Xenomax for maps[https://github.com/PredatorCZ/XenoMax]
XenoToolset for everything else[https://github.com/PredatorCZ/XenoToolset]
(Note that imported maps don't have instanced objects, and is recommended you have a lot of RAM available.)
Materials are preset as well, but need to be manually linked to correct nodes, plugins only provide related textures.

Importing Xenoblade X animations
3ds Max is the best method to extract X animations. There is also a standalone version as well(HavokLib).
You can import HKT anims(decompressed from sar archives(decompressed from HKC.cpk)) by through the HavokMax 3ds Max plugin
