**Reyn, you're a lifesafer!** This page serves as a master page for links to third-party Xenoblade-3-related resources.

## Tools

- [XenoLib](https://github.com/PredatorCZ/XenoLib)
    - A C++-based Xenoblade format parser and converter. This library is able to handle most files from Xenoblade 3, including unpacking ARD files, model and texture dumping, and more.
- [Noesis](https://www.richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91)
    - Noesis is a tool for previewing and converting between hundreds of model, image, and animation formats.
    - Noesis out of the box does not necessarily support Xenoblade model formats. See [Xenoblade-Switch-Model-Importer-Noesis] instead.
- [Xenoblade-Switch-Model-Importer-Noesis](https://github.com/Turk645/Xenoblade-Switch-Model-Importer-Noesis)
    - A Python-based Noesis-specific script that adds support for the [WISMT](/files#wismt) format that several Xenoblade games use.
    - See [Viewing and Exporting Xenoblade Models](/xenoblade-model-viewing) for more information.

## Spreadsheet

- [Model database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12wgzG4gIgd8iY6GyYw_ObsUTDjE0ZvE2CMNtX5WrWzs/) @ Google Docs
    - The model database contains a list of known models along with their internal filenames. Useful for hunting down models of specific characters.
- [Voice lines database (EN)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bhNzoqWxh-QgFg4KLatQ4pDPSn6CNwgy/) @ Google Docs
    - The voice lines database contains a list of known voice data for cutscenes and their relevant filenames.
- [Soundtrack Composer Guess Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MFfO8aTqRX8UODGAaX1R99M8As2K9T1IzyNpD-7bsRU/) @ Google Docs
    - Originally created as a fun guessing list for who composed what track in Xenoblade 3, this spreadsheet can be used to lookup the various IDs associated with the tracks of the game.
