# Alrest Wiki

This repository contains the Jekyll page behind the https://alrest.wiki, an all-in-one Xeno-series technical reverse engineering documentation. All of the pages are automatically built and served to the `gh-pages` branch via a fork of [jekyll-action](https://github.com/Still34/jekyll-action).

## Contribution

Any kind of help is wanted, as this is a massive project and undertaking for a team with less than a few members. If you had previously worked on reverse engineering any of the Xeno games from MonolithSoft, please do chip in! Anyone can open a PR to create and/or modify an existing page, though preferably an issue should be opened beforehand. If you have no idea how to open a PR, simply open an issue stating the changes you'd like, and after discussion, we will integrate it into our pages.
